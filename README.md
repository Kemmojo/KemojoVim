## About
This is my Vim Configuration. Currently and essentialy this is a copy of the [EverVim](https://github.com/LER0ever/EverVim) Configuration.
A hugh thanks and credits goes to [LER0ever](https://github.com/LER0ever) for this wonderfull peace of thoughtness.
It´s organic, it makes sence, it´s customizable and more importantly it´s like [cake](https://www.google.de/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiutb2sxdvYAhWQJ-wKHekPBUgQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lecker.de%2Fmohn-marzipan-torte-mit-nikolaus-63850.html&psig=AOvVaw3detykeJ5GUkMTjHwF-4rs&ust=1516159695933693) for your eyes.


## A little Story
At the time im wirting this, i consider myself a total Gaijin of Vim. Comming from pure design needs and learning phases to learning phases, starting with [SciTE](http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html) and [Adobe Dreamweaver](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/dreamweaver.html) in school, switching over to my beloved [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), which hooked me immediately by the power of community driven projects.
Since then i loved beeing a coding studend and part of a larger group of people driven by the force of craftsmanship even more then ever before.

A year ago, i made my move to Atom and MAN im still shaking by how much love this small window filled with characters and numbers can give us.
I am still rather new to the modern development world, and considering the massive connection increases between 2011 and 2015, i dont think this will change soon. But over the years, learning and developing my own curiosity, the light of [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) crossed my eyes, actually it strived it, like the flash of a camera.

Over time, honing my skills, glimpses of performace needs strifed through heart and fingers. And then Reddit occured with one special [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/3lywog/this_is_what_my_macvim_workflow_looks_like_what/). I started to remember blogposts of people talking about Vim. It´s like the next levelUp of typing, they said. Typing-Evolution is like that, first, there comes hitting the keyboard like a one year old, impressed by the sound of a press, followed by writing with 10 fingers. Next up looking into a Girls eyes, while impressingly writing her a whole Poem, just because you can.
Then things settled down, you know what you´re doing, thoughts of boringness while doing the usual ottonormal stuff comming up. But then, it´s like a dark forgotten force, calling you to join the party, a masterblade keeper, senseis, ninjas, the guy from town, who told you mysterious things will happen, yes... you discovered the hidden level, welcomming you pleasurable. But there is one rule, **"Do not... stop learning !"**

So readers are here now, and thank you for the invitation. :)
