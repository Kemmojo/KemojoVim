## About
This is my Vim Configuration. Currently and essentialy this is a copy of the [EverVim](https://github.com/LER0ever/EverVim) Configuration.
A hugh thanks and credits goes [LER0ever](https://github.com/LER0ever) for this wonderfull peace of thoughtness.
It´s organic, it makes sence, it´s customizable and more inportantly it´s [cake](https://www.google.de/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiutb2sxdvYAhWQJ-wKHekPBUgQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lecker.de%2Fmohn-marzipan-torte-mit-nikolaus-63850.html&psig=AOvVaw3detykeJ5GUkMTjHwF-4rs&ust=1516159695933693) for your eyes.


## A little Story
At the time im wirting this, i consider myself a total Gaijin of Vim. Comming from pure design needs and learning phases to learning phases, starting with [SciTE](http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html) and [Adobe Dreamweaver](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/dreamweaver.html), switching over to my beloved [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), which hooked me immediately by the power of community driven projects. Since then i loved beeing a coding studend and part of a larger group of people driven by the force of craftsmanship even more then ever before.
A year ago i made my move to Atom and MAN im still shaking by how much love this small window filled with characters and numbers can give us.
I am still rather new to the modern development world, and considering the massive connection increases between 2011 and 2015,i dont think this will change soon. But over the years, learning and developing my own curiosity, the light of [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) crossed my eyes, actually it strived it, like the flash of a camera. Over time, honing my skills, glimpses of performace needs strifed through heart and fingers. And then Reddit occured with one special [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/3lywog/this_is_what_my_macvim_workflow_looks_like_what/). I started to remeber blogposts of people talking about vim. that it´s like the next levelUp of typing. First, there comes hitting the board like a two year old, impressed by the sound of a press, followed by writing with 10 fingers, next up looking into Girls eyes while impressingly writing her a whole Poem, just because you can.
Then things settle down, thoughts of boringness while doing the usual ottonormal stuff comming up. But then, it´s like a dark forgotten force calls you to join the party, masterblade keeper, senseis, ninjas, yes... you discovered the hidden level welcomming you pleasurable. But there is one rule, "Do not... stop learning !"
So im here now, and thank you for the invitation. :)
